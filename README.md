Gambling is a highly additive technique for getting shit done.

## Arbitrary use rules of use
Must complete at least one quest a day

## TODO:
 - adding tasks
 - task completion
 - storing completed tasks

 - random rewards
 - animate rewards
 - make files for rewards
 - min height and width issues

 - Tests?

## Design philosophy
- Fast development, website or re-write in a more efficent language comes later (just a python prototype, see when i hit the wall)
- No external libraries
- Don't generalise, this is for you

### IDEAS
 - so instead of direct rewards we can give chests
 - also add gold and a store

## Rarity system:
common - rare - mythic
