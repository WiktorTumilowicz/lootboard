Gambling is a highly additive technique for getting shit done.

## Arbitrary use rules of use
Must complete at least one quest a day

## Design philosophy
- Fast development, website or re-write in a faster language comes later (i just want a fast development python prototype, see when i hit the wall)
- No external libraries (learn the shit yourself)
- Don't generalise, this is for your use case

## TODO:
 - daily refresh
 - task completion
 - random rewards
 - animate rewards
 - make files for each type of reward and read from files
 - min height and width issues

 - Tests?

### IDEAS
 - so instead of direct rewards we give chests
 - also add gold and a store

## Rarity system:
common-rare-mythic
